# Hackle
 
Hackle is a word guessing game inspired on the world famous [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
The only twist is that all possible words are related in some way to Computer Science. Our game also has a *Hack*
feature which, following the thematic of the game, allows the user to have an extra guess.


# How To Play

## Basic Gameplay
Playing is very easy, you can use either the on-screen keyboard or physical keyboard to enter a guess. All guesses must be 5 letters long. When you are happy with your guess, you can press the enter button, either on-screen or on your keyboard to submit your answer. For each letter you get on the right spot the tile containing that letter will turn green. For each letter that is in the incorrect spot but is part of the word the tile containing that letter will turn orange. Letters that are not part of the word will turn red.

## Hack Option
For each word you will have the ability to *hack* a guess. You can only *hack* a guess after you've made one. After making a guess, you can press the *hack* button to return to the previous guess. The coloring will dissapear but if you use your *hack* wisely you will have additional information about the correct answer. Remember that you can only use the *hack* option once per game.
